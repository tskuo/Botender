export const bot_capability = `The bot is capable of single-turn conversations, meaning it can only provide an appropriate text reply to a user's message at a time. If the user sends another follow-up message, the bot is unable to respond further. Additionally, the bot cannot perform other actions such as removing users from the server, banning users from posting, reacting with emojis, or sending direct messages to other users or moderators.`;
